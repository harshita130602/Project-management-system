# Productivity Management Tool

## Brief problem statement:
The product is related to managing employees and progress related to software projects. Based on the requirements of the project, employees with relevant skillset are shortlisted from a directory of available employees. The actual hours committed to the project will be compared against the original estimate to track its progress.


## System requirements:
The project will be a web-based application with separate client and server modules. The client would run in a web browser and would require a system capable of doing so. The server module would require a machine that can serve requests from the client based on the number of simultaneous users of the system. Based on current understanding, MERN stack seems to be a suitable choice for this project.


## User's profile:
* Manager: Need a UI that allows smooth management of projects with minimal
friction.
* Employee: Require simple setup to confirm/reject project allocations and submit
work hours.
* Head of Department: Simple dashboard to approve/deny projects and track their
progress.

All the users are directly or indirectly involved in software development so are considered
technically competent to use a standard User Interface.

## Note

Project design documents are given in "doc" directory and the code for the software is given in "src" directory.
